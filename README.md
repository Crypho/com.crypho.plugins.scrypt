# Scrypt plugin for iOS

## Introduction

This plugin is for use with [Cordova](http://incubator.apache.org/cordova/) and allows your application to use the [scrypt](http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html) key derivation function on iOS devices. It is based on [libscrypt](https://github.com/technion/libscrypt).

##<a name="installation"></a>Installation

Below are the methods for installing this plugin automatically using command line tools. For additional info, take a look at the [Plugman Documentation](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugman/blob/master/README.md) and [Cordova Plugin Specification](https://github.com/alunny/cordova-plugin-spec).

### Cordova

The plugin can be installed via the Cordova command line interface:

* Navigate to the root folder for your phonegap project.
* Run the command:

```sh
cordova plugin add https://github.com/Crypho/com.crypho.plugins.scrypt.git
```

##<a name="plugin_api"></a> Plugin API

Grab the plugin instance variable.

```js
var scrypt;

document.addEventListener("deviceready", function(){
    scrypt = window.plugins.scrypt;
    ...
});
```

You can get the derived key in hexadecimal format by invoking ``scrypt(onSuccess, onFailure, password, salt, options)``

```js
var key;

scrypt(
    function (res) { key = res; },
    function (err) { key = null },
    'password', 'salt', {N: 16384}
)
```

You can provide custom ``scrypt`` parameters in the options dict. The defaults are
```js
{
    N: 16384,
    r: 8,
    p: 1,
    dkLen: 32
}
```
